 * sandbox.h - a cage for programs Janas runs but did not write (the code a
 * model writes for code_interpreter): Linux namespaces of its own (user,
 * mount, PID, network, IPC, UTS) without privileges, a root of its own
 * with the system's /usr read-only and one directory writable, no network,
 * no other process to see, no new processes (seccomp: threads only),
 * limits on memory, file sizes and open files.
 *
 * The cage is built by the program itself run again: janas_sandbox_spawn
 * runs /proc/self/exe with janas_sandbox_exec's first argument, and a
 * program offering the cage calls janas_sandbox_main first thing in main.
 * Linux only (x86-64 and AArch64); elsewhere janas_sandbox_available says
 * why not.
